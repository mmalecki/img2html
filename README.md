img2html is simple Ruby script for converting images to HTML using RMagick.
It's been created just for fun and to see if modern browsers can handle
maaaaaaany divs.

Usage: `ruby img2html.rb path-to-image`

HTML will be written to stdout, so you may want to redirect it to some file
to avoid flooding your terminal.
